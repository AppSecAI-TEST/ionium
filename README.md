This repo contains the main website of Ionium as well as it's blogging platform.

Ionium is a startup development company dedicated to open-source software for the development and scientific community. Our goal is to provide powerful, easy to use and value adding tools and services for developers, engineers, scientists and researchers to allow them to continue to improving our lives by means of technology and science!

## Current projects in the pipeline:
These are programs currently in the pipeline and in various stages of development. Please see individual project repos for more details.
- Sigil: A cross-platform cloud based notepad aimed at developers and scientists that allows them to easily share and store their notes and work and push changes for continued integration or remote simulation (via Travis CI or Jupyter for example) (https://github.com/ionium-dev/sigil)
- Aether: A desktop application that allows scientist and engineers to develop complex simulations in real-time via a python interface that uses back-end technologies for powerful computing applications such as parallel processing, distributed and grid computing and real-time rendering using Vulkan API. (https://github.com/ionium-dev/aether)
- Ion engine: A lightweight cross-platform graphics and game engine using electron and WebGL 2.0. Made to be light and simple to use as well as performant using it's own build in rendering solution (code named "Feynman Renderer") (https://github.com/ionium-dev/ion-engine)
- Pyre: A centralized web presence. Provides an email client as well as integration with social networks for ease of login across apps. (https://github.com/ionium-dev/pyre)

## Ideas:
These are high-level ideas still in infancy and may or may not be worked on.
- Application that used Arduino systems and integration with cloud to monitor reactions and experiments remotely and accuratley in real-time.
- Alchemy: Complete base of chemical helper lookups for the chemist on the go or chemical engineers. To use Wolfram Alpha/ChemSpider/other API's.
- Registration and management app for laborers and contractors to allow people to find and rate required services such as painters, builders etc. This is a bit out of scope for Ionium (not in targeted domain). This can help the employment of workers in South Africa.
- Uppdog: What's Uppdog? Not much just a fresh spin on a chat app. It uses a sort of "gamer" scope about chatting with user joining channels such as:
  - /say - Public broadcast your message to people in your area, any listeners get notification (Local)
  - /yell - Public broadcast to everybody, any listeners get notification (Global)
  - /tell - Public direct message to individual
  - /whisper - Private message to individual
  - /group - A private group, messages go to all members (Global)
  - /party - A private group, message go to members in area (Local)

## Open-Source
We at Ionium believe in openness, as such all software and solutions will come with a open-source license such as MIT or GPL. Please note that some of the 3rd party software being used may be subjected to their own licenses. Please see individual projects for details.

## Disclaimer
This company current consists of only me (Johannes du Randt). This is a hobby project and development is mostly done at nights and on weekends. I will try to get each to a stable alpha first before real implemntation starts, but because I am just one man, I cannot work on it in parallel.
